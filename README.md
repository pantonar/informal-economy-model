Implementation of Bento, Jacobsen and Liu, 2018
Paper title: 'Environmental Policy in the Presence of an Informal Sector'

The model is a static genral equilibrium, with a formal and an informal services
sector. The model builds the baseline calibrated for the USA. Then the equilibrium
is shocked with a targeted reduction in emissions (i.e. reduction in energy output)
achieved via a tax on energy. The script solves for the tax achieving that goal.

At the same time, government income is held fixed, so that the increased revenue 
from the energy tax is compensated by a reduction of the labour income tax that 
ensures fixed government income.

The effect on GDP of this policy reveals the potential effect of climate policy
(i.e. carbon taxes) on GDP and formal economy when accompanied with carbon revenue
recycling
